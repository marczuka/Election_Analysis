## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given us the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Challenge Overview
Since not everyone has voted in this election, the election commission wants to confirm the voter turnout for each county. In this challenge, we will determine the number of votes that were cast from each county and the percentage of votes each county contributed to the election.

For the Colorado Board of Elections employee we will obtain the following data:
1. A complete list of counties taking part in the election.
2. The total number of votes cast for each county.
3. The percentage of votes cast for each county from the total vote count.
4. The county that had the largest voter turnout.

The challenge analysis code is contained in the additional file PyPoll_Challenge.py

## Challenge Summary
The additional analysis of the election is presented in the following form:
- The counties were:
    - County 1
    - County 2
    - County 3
- The vote results for the counties were:
    - County 1 cast "x%" of the vote and "y" number of votes.
    - County 2 cast "x%" of the vote and "y" number of votes.
    - County 3 cast "x%" of the vote and "y" number of votes.
- The county with the largest voter turnout was:
    - County (1, 2, or 3).

The results of the election analysis are printed to the terminal and stored in the output election_analysis.txt file.
